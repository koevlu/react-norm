# react-norm

normalized state in hooks

simple way to write ux with minimal loading awaiting

## usage

1. describe data relations with `orm`
2. create stores of related data with `store`
3. preload data with `preload(routes)` and `<PreloadLink to={url} />`
4. use it state in hooks with `useStore`

[example is the best way to see](https://github.com/koevlu/react-norm/tree/master/example)
