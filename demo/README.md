## sense

- orm with parent instances autoupdate
- SPA UX with no loading states after initializing
- transparent app architecture with 3 elements: stores, ui, router

## blowin' in the wind

- middleware
- orm.oneOf(inst => inst.hasOwnProperty('stork') ? ormX : ormY)
- items in localstorage, progressive app
- optimize <PreloadLink /> loading
- live socket connection to instances instead endless rest
- TimeTraveling inside code (cancel actions simplify, unpredictable lists trouble)
- necromantic spell for turning abstract code to both hooks and server-side db instances changes
